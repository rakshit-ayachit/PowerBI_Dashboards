 # PowerBI Dashboards
This repository contains projects for Power BI dashboards. Each project focuses on different aspects of data visualization and analysis.

## Project 1: [Employee Insights Dashboard]
The Employee Insights Dashboard is a Power BI project designed to provide visualizations and analysis of key metrics related to the HR, Resources and Development, and Sales departments within a company. This dashboard aims to help stakeholders gain valuable insights into employee data and make informed decisions based on the findings

### Features
The Employee Insights Dashboard offers the following features:

1. Department-wise Metrics: The dashboard includes separate cards for each department, displaying essential metrics such as employee count, attrition rate, average salary, and average years at the company. These cards provide a quick overview of each department's status.
2. Attrition Analysis: The dashboard presents graphical representations of attrition rates across various factors such as department, gender, and job role. These visualizations help identify patterns and trends in employee attrition, enabling stakeholders to understand the underlying reasons and take appropriate actions.
3. Interactive Filtering: Users can interact with the dashboard by filtering the data based on specific criteria. This functionality allows for deeper exploration of employee insights by customizing the view according to individual needs.
4. Drill-Down Capabilities: The dashboard offers drill-down capabilities, allowing users to dive deeper into specific data points. For example, by clicking on a particular department or gender segment, users can access more detailed information and explore related visualizations.
